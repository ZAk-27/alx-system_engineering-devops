Issue Summary:

Duration:

Start Time: March 15, 2023, 09:00 AM UTC
End Time: March 15, 2023, 02:30 PM UTC
Impact:

The ERP Accounting System experienced a complete outage during the incident, affecting all users. Financial transactions, payroll processing, and other critical accounting functions were unavailable, impacting business operations.
Root Cause:

The root cause was identified as a database corruption issue that occurred during a routine maintenance operation. This led to the unavailability of critical financial data.
Timeline:

Issue Detection:

Time: March 15, 2023, 09:00 AM UTC
Detection Method: An automated monitoring alert triggered due to a sudden spike in database error rates and a subsequent failure in executing financial transactions.
Actions Taken:

Engineers initiated an immediate investigation into the ERP Accounting System.
Assumed initial root cause to be a potential server misconfiguration.
Investigated network issues and external dependencies that could impact database operations.
Escalated the incident to the Database Administration and System Operations teams for further analysis.
Incident Escalation:

Escalated to the Database Administration and System Operations teams after initial investigation by the Development and Infrastructure teams.
Resolution:

Identified database corruption as the root cause.
Implemented a database rollback to the last known stable state.
Restored data from backups to ensure data consistency.
Deployed a hotfix to address the underlying maintenance operation that caused the corruption.
Communicated the incident and resolution details to all stakeholders.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:

The root cause was traced to a database corruption issue resulting from a routine maintenance operation. This operation, intended to optimize database performance, inadvertently led to corruption in critical financial data.
Resolution:

Immediate relief was achieved by rolling back the database to the last known stable state.
Long-term resolution involved refining the maintenance operation to prevent a recurrence of database corruption.
Implemented enhanced monitoring to detect anomalies during maintenance operations.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Conduct a comprehensive review of all maintenance operations to identify potential risks.
Enhance monitoring and alerting specifically for database integrity during maintenance.
Establish a protocol for more frequent and rigorous testing of database backups.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Immediate Actions:
Review and rollback the maintenance operation that caused the corruption.
Restore data from backups to ensure data consistency.
Short-Term Actions:
Conduct a post-incident review with the Database Administration and System Operations teams.
Enhance monitoring thresholds to trigger alerts more effectively.
Implement automated rollback procedures for critical database operations.
Long-Term Actions:
Revise and document maintenance procedures to include additional checks and safeguards.
Conduct regular drills to test the effectiveness of data restoration processes.
Establish a communication protocol for timely and accurate incident reporting to stakeholders
